Hi, I am a software developer and computer science undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/about-our-department" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of British Columbia</a> in Canada.

My main experience is in C++ and Elixir. I have also written bits of C, Java, JavaScript, Python, Bash, SQL, etc.

I value working in lean, agile teams alongside open-minded, forward-looking, pragmatic idealists with deep respect for technology and humanity.

I am searching for software development opportunities whose mission and culture aligns with these values. At this time, I am based in Western Canada and I am open to remote work and possible relocation.

My mailbox is open, please feel free to reach out at the address printed on [my site](https://peytonseigo.ca).
