## Bio

Hi, I am a software developer and computer science undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/about-our-department" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of British Columbia</a>.

I am most comfortable with C++ and Elixir. I have also written bits of Java, Bash, C, SQL, JavaScript, and Python.

I value working in lean, agile teams with open-minded, pragmatic idealists. At this time, I am based in western Canada and open to remote work.
