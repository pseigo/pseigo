## Bio

Hi, I am a software developer and computer science undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/about-our-department" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of British Columbia</a>. I've spent most of my time with C++ and Elixir in Windows and Linux environments, and have a lot more to learn. Right now I am focusing on learning design intuition and building small things thoughtfully.

My mailbox is open, feel free to reach out at the address on my home page.
