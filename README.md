## Bio

Hi, I am a software developer and <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/about-our-department" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer science</a> undergraduate. I've spent most of my time with C++ and Elixir in Windows and Linux environments and have a lot more to learn. Right now I am working on learning design intuition and building small things.
